# leaflet-challenge
The United States Geological Survey provides scientific data about natural hazards, environmental health, and the impacts of climate change. Javascript, HTML, and leaflet were used to generate a visualization of earthquakes from the data. A map was created with markers highlighting earthquake magnitude and depth, a legend, and popups giving additional information about the individual earthquakes.
